# TurboClone
## A simple for bulk device archiving
Currently supports Linux x86 only

### About
This project started as an idea to make a home project a little smoother, but I figured it would be useful to share it. This project is fully open source, so feel free to add on to it with any bug fixes, feature ideas, or anything else you think it needs.

### Function
To use TurboClone to copy your devices, simply run the program, enter some preliminary information, and enter a drive. TurboClone will automatically mount the device and start copying your files. When it's done, it will safely unmount the device and ask for another. Swap the devices, and it will go to work again. Repeat until you're done!
